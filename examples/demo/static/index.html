    <h1>Untimely Demo</h1>

    <h2>Example 1: Local Gameplay</h2>
    <p>The game runs locally only -- no multiplayer.</p>
    <p>Controls: W/A/S/D for moving the green box around.</p>

    <h2>Example 2: Client-Server</h2>
    <p>The server periodically sends out the game state to all clients.
      Clients act as "stupid terminals": they display received state 
      as soon as they get it. In return, clients send their game input to the server.</p>
