    <h1>Untimely: Box Game</h1>

    <h2>Example 1: Local Gameplay</h2>
    <p>The game runs locally only -- no multiplayer.</p>
    <p>Controls: W/A/S/D for moving the green box around.</p>
    <canvas id="example_local_canvas" width="320" height="240"></canvas>

    <h2>Example 2: Client-Server</h2>
    <p>The server periodically sends out the game state to all clients.
      Clients are "stupid terminals": they simply display the state that they received
      as soon as they get it. In return, clients send their game input to the server.</p>
